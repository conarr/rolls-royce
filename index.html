    <h1>At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock</h1>

    <h3>What makes Rolls-Royce the best car in the world? <i>&#34;There is really no magic about it - it is merely patient attention to detail,&#34;</i> says an eminent Rolls-Royce engineer.</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><i>&#34;At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise comes from the electric clock.&#34;</i> reports the Technical Editor of THE MOTOR. Three mufflers tune out sound frequencies-acoustically.</li>

        <li>Every Rolls-Royce engine is run for seven hours at full throttle before installation. and each car is test-driven for hundreds of miles over varying road surfaces.</li>

        <li>The Rolls-Royce is designed as an owner-driven car. It is eighteen inches shorter than the largest domestic cars.</li>

        <li>The car has power steering, power brakes and automatic gear-shift. It is very easy to drive and to park. No chauffeur required.</li>

        <li>The finished car spends a week in the final test-shop, being fine-tuned. Here it is subjected to 98 separate ordeals. For example, the engineers use a stethoscope to listen for axle whine.</li>

        <li>The Rolls-Royce is guaranteed for three years. With a new network of dealers and parts-depots from Coast to Coast, service is no problem.</li>

        <li>The Rolls-Royce radiator has never changed, except that when Sir Henry Royce died in 1933 the monogram RR was changed from red to black.</li>

        <li>The coachwork is given five coats of primer paint, and hand rubbed between each coat, before nine coats of finishing paint go on.</li>

        <li>By moving a switch on the steering column, you can adjust the shock-absorbers to suit road conditions.</li>

        <li>A picnic table, veneered in French walnut, slides out from under the dash. Two more swing out behind the front seats.</li>

        <li>You can get such optional extras as an Espresso coffee-making machine, a dictating machine, a bed, hot and cold water for washing, an electric razor or a telephone.</li>

        <li>There are three separate systems of power brakes, two hydraulic and one mechanical. Damage to one system will not affect the others. The Rolls-Royce is a very safe car - and also a very lively car. It cruises serenely at eighty-five. Top speed is in excess of 100 m.p.h.</li>

        <li>The Bentley is made by Rolls-Royce. Except for the radiators, they are identical motor cars, manufactured by the same engineers in the same works. People who feel diffident about driving a Rolls-Royce can buy a Bentley.</li>
